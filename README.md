# imagenoid

Convert a XHDPI image to lower ones (ldpi, mdpi and hdpi). Can be used for Android projects.

#### Read this:
When I was studying Android programming I needed to convert images for different sizes to be fit to different screen sizes, so I wrote this code. I do not know if it is really useful, but at least, this code can be cloned or forked and to be continued.

## Usage:

```bash
java -jar imagenoid-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

Feel free to help this project.
